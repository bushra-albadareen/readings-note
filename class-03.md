# LISTS
There are three types of HTML lists: 
- ordered, use numbers.
- unordered, use bullets.
- definition, are used to define terminology.

> Lists can be nested inside one another.

# BOXES
CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box, control the dimensions of a box and control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.

# Java Conditions and If Statements

- Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
Equal to a == b
Not Equal to: a != b


- Java has the following conditional statements:

> Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
> Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.
> Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.
> Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.

# Domain modeling 

the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.


- When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
- Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
- Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
- Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
- Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
- Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.


# TABLES

- The <table> element is used to add tables to a web page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the <tr> element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a
header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>,<tbody>, and <tfoot>.

# TEXT

HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).


# CSS
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

# javascript

- The HTML script tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).
The script element either contains script statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute. Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.To select an HTML element, JavaScript most often uses the document.getElementById() method.

- JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var/ let keyword.

- A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables). The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas: (parameter1, parameter2, ...) The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

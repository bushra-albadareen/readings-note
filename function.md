# Functions
In Java, all function definitions must be inside classes. We also call functions methods. Let's look at an example method

public class Main {
    public static void foo() {
        // Do something here
    }
}

# Arguments
I always like to say that arguments to Java methods are passed by value, although some might disagree with my choice of words, I find it the best way to explain and understand how it works exactly.

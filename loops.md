# Definition of for loop
In Java, there are two forms of for loops. The first form is “traditional” form and the second is “for-each” form.

- Initialization: The initialization of the loop controlling variable of for loop is executed only once, during the first iteration of the loop. Here, the loop controlling variable is initialized, sometimes if the loop variable is not used again anywhere in the program and is only used as the controlling variable of the loop, then it is both declared and initialized in the ‘for’ loop.
- Condition: The condition of the ‘for’ loop is executed each time the loop is iterated.
- Increment and iteration: The iteration statement is an expression that increment or decrements the loop controlling variable.

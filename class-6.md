# problem domain
The first step in writing a program is to determine what kind of information our program will need to represent digitally (such as mathematical operands and operators), and to know what functions we will need to apply to that data (such as addition, or printing an error message to the screen). I refer to this collectively as the problem domain, and a great way to figure out what it looks like is to start with a problem statement.

# Object Literal
A JavaScript object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package. This minimizes the use of global variables which can cause problems when combining code.

# What is the DOM?

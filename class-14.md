# CSS Animations

- CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash!

- animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.

- You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want.

- To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.

- Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.
